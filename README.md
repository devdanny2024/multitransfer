# NFT Multi-Transfer App

This is a React.js project designed to facilitate the transfer of multiple NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) from one address to another in a single transaction. The app integrates with Ethereum wallets (such as MetaMask) and uses smart contracts to batch transfer NFTs, making it a fast and easy way to send multiple tokens at once.

## Features

- **Connect to Wallet**: Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (MetaMask) to the app.
- **Batch NFT Transfer**: Transfer multiple NFTs from one wallet address to another in a single transaction.
- **Supports ERC-721 Tokens**: The app works with any standard ERC-721 NFTs.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Users are notified when transactions are being processed and completed.
- **Transaction History**: Track the history of transfers made through the app.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for failed or canceled transactions.
